Genrator -
yield - The yield keyword is used to return a list of values from a function.
	  -	Unlike the return keyword which stops further execution of the function, the yield keyword continues to the end of the function.

decorators - In Python, decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods,
			without changing their actual code

  
constructor - 
In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class.
	__new__: Creates a new instance of a class.
	__init__: Initializes the created instance.
	Type : 1) default constructor - 
				class Car:
					def __init__(self):
						#Initialize the Car with default attributes
						self.make = "Toyota"
						self.model = "Corolla"
						self.year = 2020
						
				# Creating an instance using the default constructor
				car = Car()
				print(car.make)
				print(car.model)
				print(car.year)
				
		   2) parameterized constructor -
				class Car:
					def __init__(self, make, model, year):
						#Initialize the Car with specific attributes.
						self.make = make
						self.model = model
						self.year = year

				# Creating an instance using the parameterized constructor
				car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022)
				print(car.make)
				print(car.model)
				print(car.year)

Syntax			complex and difficult 				easy and readable

Performance		slow due to design					improved compared to python 2

range 			xrange()							range() more efficiant 


diff in set and frozen set : 

	both are same just frozen set is immutable. you can not add or remove the values

super(): 
		When you use super(), you're referring to the parent class, and you can call methods or access attributes of that class.
		The advantage of using super() is that you donâ€™t have to explicitly reference the parent class by name.
